### :wave: Hey there! My name is David!

I'm a technical leader working out of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex in the United States of America. I get to play with cool technology all day and work with an awesome team.

I get to work with an amazing team at ABC Fitness Solutions. We're building super cool stuff over there for our incredible customers and their members. 

I believe in work/life balance and have recently been focused on travelling the world. I'm also usually tinkering with someting in my lab or have my camera out taking photos. I am also a pretty big movie buff. :) 

I occasionally put projects here on Github, but most of my work is in private repos or on my private git server. I believe in infrastructure as code and composable infrastructure. I mainly work with AWS and Kubernetes.
